# PG_sem4

This repository contains code and materials developed during the 4th semester at Gdańsk University of Technology. Each folder corresponds to a specific subject or course, showcasing lab exercises, individual projects, and practical experiments.

## 📁 ArtificialIntelligence

Labs covering fundamental AI topics:
- `lab1-linear_Regression` – Linear regression implementation
- `lab2-Genetic_algorithm` – Simple genetic algorithm
- `lab3-MinMax_algorithm` – MinMax algorithm for connect4 game
- `lab4-classification` – Basic classification tasks
- `lab5-clustering` – Unsupervised learning using clustering
- `lab6 - artificial neural network` – Neural network experiments
- `lab7 - reinforcement learning` – Intro to RL, on simple pyGame example

## 📁 DistributedProcessing

Covers topics in parallel and distributed systems:
- `linux/` – Code targeting Linux systems
- `trojan/` – Simple funny malware that starts a thread looking for a word "hamster" in copyied text. Once it finds it, malware replaces the text with a url to google images site with hamster pictures.
- `lab1.c`, `procecy.c`, `thread_windows.c` – Low-level C programs demonstrating process/thread handling on Windows and Linux

## 📁 EmbeddedSystems

Includes labs and small projects for embedded devices and microcontrollers. Involve C++ codes and hardware control.

## 📁 NumericsMethods

Numerical methods course material. Includes:
- Algorithms for solving equations, numerical integration/differentiation, and matrix operations.
- Code written in Matlab.

## 📁 ProbabilisticMethods

Code related to probabilistic reasoning, simulations, or statistics. Includes:
- Basic combinatorial problems
- Uniformly distributed random number generators
- Random number generators with arbitrary distribution
- Multivariate random variables

## 📁 macOS

Simple codes in swift, from basic syntax learning, to minigames
